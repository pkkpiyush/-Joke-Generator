# Joke-Generator

A fun and interactive mini project built to apply my knowledge of APIs and JSON. The app fetches live jokes from JokeAPI and dynamically displays them on screen.

It supports both one-liner and two-part jokes, with proper API integration and async error handling.

Features:
1. Random joke generation via API
2. Dynamic type, question, and answer rendering
3. Loading-safe error handling
4. Responsive and clean UI using custom CSS
